The human body runs on its own biological computer with DNA as its code. At compile time, DNA synthesizes from its original form to mRNA, converting genetic information into proteins. mRNA is code for proteins synthesized at the ribosome. Since DNA and mRNA occur in sequences, as has been helpful for the human genome project and other projects looking to study human biology from a genomic perspective, AI can also play a role in learning about our coding and that of other organisms.

Enter Natural Language Processing. Since proteins, DNA sequences, and their encodings are all mathematical objects (or can be treated as such) from the AI's perspective,  we can directly apply tools from Natural Language Processing (a field broadly referring to the application of artificial intelligence to language data) in bioinformatics contexts. In other words, a signal processing problem, like deciphering voices in a noisy room can be seen as analogous to a bioinformatics problem like unraveling the multiple sequences in a meta genome. Moreover, an AI that can understand what a person might say next (made possible via a transformer architecture trained on a corpus of text) can also predict how a virus will evolve next if trained on a bioinformatics dataset.

Several groups have been jumping at this conclusion and the opportunity to use AI language systems for the study of human biology.
